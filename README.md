well this is kind of self explanatory, innit?

Why hello there, I'm Horibyte, just your average webdev....and professional tech breaker, too!

This place shall be the place where I put my open-source projects, like my website!

You can check me on other platforms via going to the sites that my links go to.

And always remember......ðŸ…°
